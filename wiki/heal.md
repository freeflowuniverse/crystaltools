# Heal

Auto healing feature

```bash
export HEAL=1
```

If above is set the following will happen

- find pages/images on other sides and link/copy them to the current site (if no heal, it will just show an error)
- if double files (e.g. images), it will remove the double files first keep _.png then .png, then ._jpg, then .jpg

> USE this carefully, can have lots of non intended consequestions, only experts should use this
