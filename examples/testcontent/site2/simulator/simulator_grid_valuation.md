For hosting (cloud) business valuation is typically calculated based on recurring revenue or net margin.

- It can easily go upto 10 times in recurring yearly margin 
- It can go upto 5-6 times in recurring yearly revenue 

Multiples are that high because of its recurring revenue.

> If an acquirer would buy at 10 times recurring margin and there would be 0% growth (which is not realistic), it would mean that the acquirer would have all money back in 10 years of the acquisition cost.
