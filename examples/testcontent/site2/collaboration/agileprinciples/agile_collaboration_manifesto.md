# Manifesto for Agile Collaboration

![](sky.png)

We are uncovering better ways of collaboration:

We value:

- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools

- **Results & Transparency** over comprehensive documentation/specs

- **Customer/Stakeholder collaboration** over contract negotiation

- **Responding to change** over following a plan

## Principles behind the Agile Manifesto

- Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer/stakeholder through early and continuous delivery of results.

- Welcome changing requirements, even late in the process. Agile processes harness change for the stakeholders competitive advantage.

- Deliver results frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.

- Business/Stakeholders and Scrum Team Members must work together very often throughout the project. This requires full transparency and communication (e.g. comments in story cards)

- Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done. 

- Scrum Team members value respect more than any other value. Respect for stakeholders, team members, ... Mistakes are normal and an expected step in the process. Members need to help each other where possible. Respect also means communicate enough (tangible, so it can be followed by others easily)

- The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a scrum team is face-to-face (zoom) conversation. BUT remember, there can be many others who want to have this information too. Specs and docs belong in the EE. Comments on stories are a very good way to document process and communicate with all stakeholders.

- Results are the primary measure of progress.

- Agile processes promote sustainable collaboration. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

- Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

- Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.

- The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.

- At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

## Scrum Values

### Focus
Because we focus on only a few things at a time, we work well together and produce excellent work. We deliver valuable items sooner.

### Courage
Because we work as a team, we feel supported and have more resources at our disposal. This gives us the courage to undertake greater challenges.

### Openness
As we work together, we express how we're doing, what's in our way, and our concerns so they can be addressed.

### Commitment
Because we have great control over our own destiny, we are more committed to success.

### Respect
As we work together, sharing successes and failures, we come to respect each other and to help each other become worthy of respect.
