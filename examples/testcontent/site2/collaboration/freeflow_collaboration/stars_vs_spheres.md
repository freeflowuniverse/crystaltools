# From stars to spheres

In a pyramid you report to a boss, who will do their weekly reviews to see how you're doing.
You will probably together create documents to agree on what needs to be achieved, this happens with your boss typically.

> The current paradigm: The boss ```trusts``` you to do your job, you trust your boss to protect you and be fair to you.

This trust based mechanism at first sight feels very nice but has lots of side effects.
Read [notes_on_reinventing_organizations](notes_on_reinventing_organizations.md), this shows you issues with organization styles.

Above is typically known as 'red' or 'orange' style. Orange is the modern management style used in most large US or Europe based companies.

In such an organization there seems to be a lot of freedom on each level e.g. if a manager of a team wants to change the tools they use it will still work, because its a pyramid. It goes top down and back up.

Main issues:

- Limited consensus on priorities
- Very quickly becomes political (especially in orange organizations, too easy for people to abuse the system of feedback loops, ...)
- Quickly leads to inefficiencies, huge amounts of time lost because of admin/politics overhead
- The people moving to the top are typically not the ones with biggest added value
- Its a survival of the fittest model
- Values are very quickly forgotten

A pyramid like system is a system which fits in the current 3D world.

> The new paradigm: circles group people & projects, and we work as a participatory organization to realize our joint goals.
