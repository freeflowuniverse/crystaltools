## Respect Human Rights

* Sustainable = green (our world needs some help)
* Available for all: which also means affordable, not owned by a big company with as purpose greed.
* Decentralised: make sure technology is available everywhere
* Open & interoperable: allow techno to work together in open way
* Accessible: easy to access, fast enough, everywhere in the world
* Secure & private: protect your assets from the evil forces out there (-:
* Make sure that any company involved follows our value

## Respect Human Effort

* Make sure technology is reliable and lasts longer (no need to replace in 5 years).
* Avoid complexity (KIS): no unnecessary complexity.
* LESS = MORE (do less to achieve more)
* Let people/companies work together in a 100% transparent way.

## Respect Human Experience

* Products should be ergonomic & easy to use
* Design should be global: don’t favor certain user groups !
* Products should look good, it will give us a better feeling
* TRANSPARENT: sales, pricing, processes, 

**Design your organisations so that your core values are respect for human rights, 
	respect for human effort, and respect for human experience.**
