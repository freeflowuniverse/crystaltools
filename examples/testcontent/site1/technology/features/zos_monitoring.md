# ZOS Monitoring


ZOS collects data from deployed solutions and applications and presents data in a well known open source monitoring solution called prometheus.

Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit originally built at SoundCloud. Since its inception in 2012, many companies and organizations have adopted Prometheus, and the project has a very active developer and user community. It is now a standalone open source project and maintained independently of any company. 

For more elaborate overviews of Prometheus, see [here](https://prometheus.io/)

### Features

- a multi-dimensional data model with time series data identified by metric name and key/value pairs
- PromQL, a flexible query language to leverage this dimensionality
- no reliance on distributed storage; single server nodes are autonomous
- time series collection happens via a pull model over HTTP
- pushing time series is supported via an intermediary gateway
- targets are discovered via service discovery or static configuration
- multiple modes of graphing and dashboarding support

### Components

The Prometheus ecosystem consists of multiple components, many of which are optional:

- the main Prometheus server which scrapes and stores time series data
- client libraries for instrumenting application code
- a push gateway for supporting short-lived jobs
- special-purpose exporters for services like HAProxy, StatsD, Graphite, etc.
- an alertmanager to handle alerts
- various support tools
