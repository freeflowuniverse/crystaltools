Veda is an organization who wants to promote better ways of working together and has created 4 core values.

## RESPECT

Respect means I fully value and honor the nature, truth and openness from someone or something, even if it is totally opposite or unknown to me. I see and value someone or something in its totality and I fully accept it. 

Respect is one of the most important values in a multicultural environment. To truly respect other living beings and the planet one needs to be respectful towards oneself and their own nature. 

Respecting oneself is the seed of respect towards others. If one does not feel respect for one’s own body, mind and soul, it will never be possible to respect the other. Respect your own integrity and boundaries and respect the boundaries and the integrity of the others.

In a co-working environments it's also important to have respect for [human effort](https://docs.grid.tf/dividi/values/src/branch/master/kristof_build_a_better_world_manifesto.md#respect-human-effort-).




## OPENNESS

Openness is having the courage to be vulnerable and naked towards yourself and others and allow yourself to see and to be seen in your full potential but also with your shadow side. 

Only when you are ready to be completely open about the positive and the negative, you can also acknowledge and accept the positive and the negative from others. By accepting both sides we become one, we see oneness and connections and we step out of the duality and understand our own truth and the truth of others.

Once we fully accept the negative, fear can be gradually released and love and compassion can grow. Fear to be judged, fear not to belong or fear not to be enough. Releasing all these fears creates space for free flow of love and compassion. 


## LOVE

Unconditional love is complete love without any condition and demands. In all you do, you need to operate with and from an open heart to give and receive unconditional love. A constant learning is required to  remove blockages and conditionings which prevent you from loving with an open heart and stepping out of fear. Reflect on every action you take and make sure it is driven by love.

Creating together a space where everybody feels safe and motivated to act from their heart and share honestly  love is a basic requirement. Everybody must help each other to step into this sacred love space.

Go out in the world and teach by example. Actions are so much more powerful than words.
