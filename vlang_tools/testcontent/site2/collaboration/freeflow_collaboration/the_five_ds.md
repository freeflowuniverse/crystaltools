# The five D's

![](5balls.png)

We believe that for every larger strategic or tactical topic in an organization we need to follow a certain evolution to mature that topic.

## What are they

Let's use the following example:

A company defines which tools they will use to collaborate together.

### Debate

In the debate phase everyone can give their input, eventually consensus has been achieved and the document has been created.

### Document

A document (can be more than 1 of course) is required to make sure that everyone agrees on the content of the topic & consensus found. Once the document phase is over everyone understands that this is it, we go for it.
Its important to have the document(s) version controlled.

### Discipline

In the discipline stage,  everyone needs to follow the document(s) and do everything they can to make it work. If there are good suggestions to make changes this can be registered in a "change management" funnel but as long as there is no new agreed version of the document everything as described in the document is reality.


### Drill

A certain percentage of people will have a hard time to be disciplined and follow the consensus achieved.
For these people we get into the Drill mode which means they will be helped by their colleagues to follow what has been agreed upon.

### Door

Unfortunately some people will after all of this effort not be able to follow, it could be that the organization (circle) will have to ask them to leave the circle because not being disciplined means they harm the circle.



## What if we find mistakes in the chosen solution.

Nothing is ever perfect, the document has been created with all best intentions and knowledge at that time in mind. Of Course changes will be required.

Change requests get registered in a "circle" funnel where change requests can be given a certain priority.
Once the relevant circle believes (by means of stakeholder consensus) that the changes need to be implemented then the 5D's process restarts all over again for the topic.

It's important to have this process well documented.
