# you can use a title, is not important

Can also type text or any other markdown content

!!!wiki name:kristof url:'https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/info_manual3/tree/development/wiki'

note how above specifies a branch name, its the full path to where the wiki is

can be based on filepath too

!!!wiki name:test path:'../wiki'

In the simpliest form your config is just couple of lines starting with !!!wiki
